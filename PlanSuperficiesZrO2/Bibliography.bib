abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro. All rights reserved. The use of nuclear reactor as a source of electric energy has been extended and consolidated during the second half of last century and the beginnings of XXI century. The continuity of this resource relies on the reliability and security of nuclear plants, requiring the improvement of all features related to their operation. Among them, the structural elements integrity that depends strongly on the mechanical stability of protective oxides must be taken into account. Zircaloy-4 (zirconium based alloy with Sn, Fe and Cr additions) is used for the coolant channels at CNA I and CNA II plants. However, this alloy suffers corrosion problems which have caused, for example, the replacement of coolant channels at CNA I in 1988. In this work we analyze from functional density theory (DFT) the properties of low index hexagonal Zr surface and of the experimentally observed tetragonal ZrO2surface. Our results predict Zr(1120) and O terminated ZrO2with Zr subsurface, as the surfaces with the lowest superficial energy. The Zr(1010) surface exhibits the most inhomogeneous charge density. This feature could favor oxygen adsorption and then the oxide growth, in agreement with the experimentally observed Zr(1010)/ZrO2(001) interface.},

abstract = {Stress-corrosion cracking of steel is a ubiquitous phenomenon in which steel is chemically corroded, followed by fracture induced by applied loads. The products of steel corrosion in moist air at high temperature ({\textgreater}570 C) are a-Fe2O3, FeO, and Fe3O4. Here we employ an ab initio density functional theory + U method to predict the tensile properties of these oxides, to gain insight into failure mechanisms. The universal binding energy relationship of Hayes et al. is employed to extrapolate atomic scale data to macroscopic sample sizes. The extrapolated macroscopic predictions are consistent with experimental measurements. The ordering of tensile strengths is shown to be FeO {\textless} Fe3O4 {\textless} a-Fe2O3, which correlates with increasing ionicity (as given by the formal charge on the Fe cations) in the three oxides. The direction that has weakest tensile strength is predicted to be along [01" 1 (3/2)(a/c)2 2] for a-Fe2O3 and along [001] for both FeO and Fe3O4. The direction dependence of tensile properties for these three iron oxides can be understood via a local bond strain analysis. We also predict that loading FeO along [110] and Fe3O4 along [001] or [111] produces a plastic response prior to brittle fracture at high temperature},

abstract = {Periodic density functional theory (DFT) and DFT+U calculations are used to evaluate various mechanical properties associated with the fracture of chromia (Cr2O3) along the [0 0 0 1] and [0 1 over(1, -) (3 / 2) (a / c)2 2] directions. The properties investigated include the tensile strength, elastic constants, and surface energies. The tensile strengths are evaluated using an ideal tensile test, which provides the theoretical tensile strength, and by fitting the calculated data to universal binding energy relationships (UBER), which permit the extrapolation of the calculated results to arbitrary length scales. The results demonstrate the ability of the UBER to yield a realistic estimate of the tensile strength of a 10-$\mu$m-thick sample of Cr2O3 using data obtained through calculations on nanoscopic systems. We predict that Cr2O3 will fracture most easily in the [0 1 over(1, -) (3 / 2) (a / c)2 2] direction, with a best estimate for the tensile strength of 386 MPa for a 10 $\mu$m grain, consistent with flexural strength measurements for chromia. The grain becomes considerably stronger at the nanoscale, where we predict a tensile strength along the same direction of 32.1 GPa for 1.45 nm crystallite. The results also provide insight into the origin of the direction dependence of the mechanical properties of Cr2O3, with the differences in the behavior along different directions being related to the number of Cr-O bonds supporting the applied tensile load. Additionally, the results shed light on various practical aspects of modeling the mechanical properties of materials with DFT+U calculations and in using UBERs to estimate the mechanical properties of materials across disparate length scales. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {An in-depth understanding of the phase stability in ZrO 2 film is very important for improving the corrosion resistance of zirconium alloys. ZrO 2 film formed on Zr-2.5Nb alloys was characterized by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction. It is shown that in comparison to the monoclinic phase crystallites, the tetragonal phase crystallites undergo larger compressive strain, indicating that there are some regions of local stress concentration in ZrO 2 film. These local stresses have an important influence on the phase stability in ZrO 2 film. In this paper, the correlation among the macroscopic compressive stress, the grain size and the local stress was analyzed qualitatively from a thermodynamic viewpoint, showing that the tetragonal phase may be partly stabilized by the local stresses. The local stresses mainly come from three sources: the local transformation strain produced by the tetragonal → monoclinic phase transformation, the oxidization of intermetallic precipitates and the different matching degrees between the ZrO 2 and Zr-based crystallites. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The bulk structure, the relative stability, and the electronic properties of monoclinic, tetragonal, and cubic ZrO2 have been studied from a theoretical point of view, through periodic ab initio calculations using different Gaussian basis sets together with Hartree-Fock (HF), pure Density Functional Theory (DFT), and mixed HF/DFT schemes as found in hybrid functionals. The role of a posteriori empirical correction for dispersion, according to the Grimme D2 scheme, has also been investigated. The obtained results show that, among the tested functionals, PBE0 not only provides the best structural description of the three polymorphs, but it also represents the best compromise to accurately describe both the geometric and electronic features of the oxide. The relative stability of the three phases can also be qualitatively reproduced, as long as thermal contributions to the energy are taken into account. Four low-index ZrO2 surfaces [monoclinic (-111), tetragonal (101 and 111), and cubic (111)] have then been studied at this latter level of theory. Surface energies, atomic relaxations, and electronic properties of these surfaces have been computed. The most stable surface is the cubic one, which is associated to small relaxations confined to the outermost layers. It is followed by the monoclinic (-111) and the tetragonal (101), which have very similar surface energies and atomic displacements. The tetragonal (111) was instead found to be, by far, the less stable with large displacements not only for the outermost but also for deeper layers. Through the comparison of different methods and basis sets, this study allowed us to find a reliable and accurate computational protocol for the investigation of zirconia, both in its bulk and surfaces forms, in view of more complex technological applications, such as ZrO2 doped with aliovalent oxides as found in solid oxide fuel cells. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Both constant-wavelength and polychromatic neutron beams have been used to define the texture of specimens from a warm-rolled and annealed Zircaloy-4 plate, and from a Zr-2.5{\%}Nb pressure tube. Measurements were also compared to synchrotron high energy X-ray diffraction experiments, as a complementary volumetric technique with much shorter data collection times compared to neutrons. Results are qualitatively consistent and reproducible in terms of pole figures and orientation distribution function, underlining the suitability of neutrons for bulk texture measurements. Expected uncertainty of measurements has been quantified by global parameters such as texture indexes and Kearns factors, and local parameters associated to the main texture components (volume fraction, centroids, and widths of fiber components). The typical uncertainties found for these parameters are compared to spatial differences found in a small batch of cold-rolled Zr-2.5{\%}Nb pressure tubes.},

In this paper, a simple model has been established to simulate the effects of cracks/voids on diffusion process. This model can be potentially used to study the influences of oxide cracks on hydrogen permeation.

In this context, we have performed ab initio DFT calculations to determine the atomic structure, work of separation ($\gamma$), and bonding character of the Fe(001)/Fe3O4(001) interface. Three candidate interface geometries were considered, including Fe and FeO2 terminations of the oxide. The minimization of the forces resulted in substantial changes to the atomic structure of the metal and oxide layer at both side of the interface, and also of the subsurface layer of the oxide in the case of Fe-terminated oxide slab. Moreover, the relaxation of the geometry in one of the two considered Fe-terminated oxide interface leads to completely unstable interface structures. By applying several methods of analysis, we have thoroughly characterized the electronic structure and have determined that the dominant bonding mechanism is the metallic-ionic interaction between the iron atoms of both metal and oxide slabs. Our calculations predict $\gamma$ ≈1.42 J/m2 regardless of the interfacial stoichiometry.},
